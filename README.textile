h1. Cassandra Bulk Interface

A simplfied bulk interface to Cassandra that makes use of Hadoop. There is some support for using the binary memtable interface but this is experimental and should be used with caution.


h2. Insert a flat tsv table

This is by far the most common use case. Suppose you have a flat tab-separated-values table on the hdfs with fields (user_id, screen_name, ip_address). To insert such a table do:

<pre><code>
  bin/cassandra-bulkload --host=<ip_of_some_cassandra_seed> --table --ks=MyKeySpace --cf=MyColumnFamily --col_names=user_id,screen_name,ip_address /path/to/tsv-table
</code></pre>

h2. Insert a flat table with a filler value.

As is often the case with a graph you'll have something like an adjacency list (node_id, {v1,v2,...,vn}). If it's just a flat graph (no edge metadata) then simply do:

<pre><code>
  bin/cassandra-bulkload --host=<ip_of_some_cassandra_seed> --columns --ks=MyGraphKeyspace --cf=MyGraphColumnFamily /path/to/adj-list
</code></pre>

h3. Insert a map

Also quite common, and the use case Cassandra addresses rather well. (key, column_name, column_value)
